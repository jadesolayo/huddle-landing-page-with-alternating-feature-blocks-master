## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
-  CSS Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

While I was working on his project, I used CSS Flexbox to structure the contents of the layout which was quite easy and made it easily responsive. Although, I tried using SASS which I ended up not using as I was still completely new to it and was having a hard time working with it. I hope to implement in future Preojects though.



### Continued development

In Future, I would love to continue using CSS Flexbox to create responsive layouts and also implement CSS Grids too. I will also consider using SASS
